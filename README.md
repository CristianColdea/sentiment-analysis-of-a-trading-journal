#sentiment analysis of a trading journal

Trading the markets is still an unreached objective for many traders, who are
making the same mistakes over and over again. Keeping a trading journal is among
the most important steps in order to become a disciplined trader. Just keeping
it doesn't bring much benefits, revising it on regular basis is even more
important. The problem is trader's subjectivity on evaluating correctly the past
mistakes, especially regarding thoughts and observations.
This mini-project is just in an infant stage, but is showing that analysing the
sentiment of the trading journal is possible, thus facilitating a better
learning from past mistakes.

Note: the journal format and data preprocessing in order to allow the effective
sentiment analysis step is not covered.
